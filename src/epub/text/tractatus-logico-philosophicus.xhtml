							<p>(Frege’s assertion sign “<m:math alttext="⊢"><m:mo>⊢</m:mo></m:math>” is logically altogether meaningless; in Frege (and Russell) it only shows that these authors hold as true the propositions marked in this way. “<m:math alttext="⊢"><m:mo>⊢</m:mo></m:math>” belongs therefore to the propositions no more than does the number of the proposition. A proposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it is true.)</p>
							<p>If the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the schema is once for all determined by a rule of combination, then the last column is by itself an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column as a row the propositional sign becomes: “<m:math alttext="(TTT⁠—T)(p,q)"><m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">—</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">(</m:mo><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mo separator="true">,</m:mo><m:mi>q</m:mi><m:mo fence="true">)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>,” or more plainly, “<m:math alttext="(TTTFT)(p,q)"><m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">F</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo fence="true">(</m:mo><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mo separator="true">,</m:mo><m:mi>q</m:mi><m:mo fence="true">)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>”.</p>

							<p>It is natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize the meaning of the sign containing it from the argument just as much as from the index.</p>
							<p>In Russell’s “<m:math alttext="+_c"><m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:msub></m:math>”, for example, “<m:math alttext="c"><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:math>” is an index which indicates that the whole sign is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this way of symbolizing depends on arbitrary agreement, and one could choose a simple sign instead of “<m:math alttext="+_c"><m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:msub></m:math>”: but in “~p” “<m:math alttext="p"><m:mi>p</m:mi></m:math>” is not an index but an argument; the sense of “~p” <em>cannot</em> be understood, unless the sense of “<m:math alttext="p"><m:mi>p</m:mi></m:math>” has previously been understood. (In the name Julius Caesar, Julius is an index. The index is always part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <em>The</em> Caesar of the Julian gens.)</p>
							<p>The confusion of argument and index is, if I am not mistaken, at the root of Frege’s theory of the meaning of propositions and functions. For Frege the propositions of logic were names and their arguments the indices of these names.</p>

							<p>In order to recognize a tautology as such, we can, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs in the tautology, make use of the following intuitive method: I write instead of “<m:math alttext="p"><m:mi>p</m:mi></m:math>”, “<m:math alttext="q"><m:mi>q</m:mi></m:math>”, “<m:math alttext="r"><m:mi>r</m:mi></m:math>”, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, “<m:math alttext="TpF"><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">F</m:mi></m:math>”, “<m:math alttext="TqF"><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi>q</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">F</m:mi></m:math>”, “<m:math alttext="TrF"><m:mi mathvariant="normal">T</m:mi><m:mi>r</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="normal">F</m:mi></m:math>”, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> The truth-combinations I express by brackets, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr>:</p>

							<p>The logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or rather they present it. They “treat” of nothing.

It is clear that it must show something about the world that certain combinations of symbols⁠—which essentially have a definite character⁠—are tautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We said that in the symbols which we use something is arbitrary, something not. In logic only this expresses: but this means that in logic it is not <em>we</em> who express, by means of signs, what we want, but in logic the nature of the essentially necessary signs itself asserts.

							<p>Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the description of the universe to a unified form. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular black spots. We now say: Whatever kind of picture these make I can always get as near as I like to its description, if I cover the surface with a sufficiently fine square network and now say of every square that it is white or black. In this way I shall have brought the description of the surface to a unified form. This form is arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal success a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. It can happen that the description would have been simpler with the aid of a triangular mesh; that is to say we might have described the surface more accurately with a triangular, and coarser, than with the finer square mesh, or vice versa, and so on. To the different networks correspond different systems of describing the world. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying: All propositions in the description of the world must be obtained in a given way from a number of given propositions⁠—the mechanical axioms. It thus provides the bricks for building the edifice of science, and says: Whatever building thou wouldst erect, thou shalt construct it in some manner with these bricks and these alone.</p>
